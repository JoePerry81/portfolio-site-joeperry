          Surf Alert is a location based surf forecast app with tailored push notifications to keep the user informed of chosen conditions at their favorite spots.

            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>To provide surf forecasts that are relevant to the user.</p>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>
              To provide the enthusiastic user the functionality to set up customizable forecast alerts that they deem relevant.

            <h2>user flow</h2>
            <p>
              With my mvp or "minimum viable product" and key features in mind it was time to start putting together a user flow that allowed diverse users to accomplish those key features. It was a challenge to keep this user flow small. The
              tendency is to try to give your users everything they could possibly desire. This can really increase the scope of the project quickly. I find it best to focus on a few key features to start with and make sure the app accomplishes those
              features well, knowing that in later iterations you can add features that enrich the users experience as the app grows and matures.

            <h2>competitive research</h2>
            <p>
              A surf report app isn’t a new app concept. “Magic Seaweed” and “Surfline” are examples of widely used apps in the space. There are some patterns and elements from all that would better serve users if they were consolidated. Also, I plan
              to add a spot specific forum to inspire sharing insights and media related to that particular spot.
            </p>

            <h3>research findings</h3>
            <p>
              As stated in the mvp objective some users want a top level summary while others want in-depth information and a glimpse into the future. Something that the reviewed competitors didn't offer is a spot specific forum. This adds value to
              the user by giving insights from other like minded users that these other apps couldn't provide.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, maybe the conditions are quite better than what the forecast predicts, or someone recently spotted a tiger shark in the line up. Maybe you finally stuck that arial you've been working on and you want to post some footage
              for the local crowd to see. The spot specific forum can facilitate this type of enhancement of the user experience, all while generating a sense of community. </p>

              The end result of the research and design execution for the surf spot specific pages was to use a three tab interface. Beginning with high level information including weather and recommended boards and attire (i.e wetsuit gage).
              Followed by an in-depth forecast including swell direction, wind, and tide among other relevant information and an extended forecast. Finally the third tab houses the spot specific forum with real time updates from other users.

              User testing is a great way to understand and test if the product design is having the intended consequences. Through user testing this prototype some unintended consequences of my patterns and developing style guide where brought to
              light. After all, if the design isn't making the user experience intuitive and clear then it needs to be adjusted accordingly, no matter how good the designer thinks it looks.

              I felt that the bars of color under the “About” and “Posts” headers on the Profile screen were dong more harm than good. I originally thought they were a nice design element to help segregate my screen content. However, after reviewing
              my prototype, I realized the color bars were having unintended consequences on my screen hierarchy. After playing with the design, I thought it best to remove them, as you can see in the updated screen above.

              In an attempt to offer consistency in my design patterns. I used the toggle design pattern on the Log In screen that I was already using on the Notifications screen(shown in the middle on the screen above). This offers the overall
              design more consistency and familiarity to the end user. I applied the same changes to the Sign Up screen as well.

              My original intention with the Location screen was to utilize the Surf Alert logo to mark the surf locations on the map. Offering a little consistency and repetition with the logo use. After reviewing the feedback on this screen I
              realized my logo was not translating at smaller sizes. I decided to take my users advice on this screen and use a custom location pin to eliminate confusion. Consequently, I felt it necessary to update the navigation icon that
              corresponds to the Location.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also agreed with my users on creating more contrast in the Navigation Bar.

              I increased the weight of the fonts used on the Favorites page to increase readability. In an attempt to be a little kinder to the end user’s eye.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              When building an app for multiple platforms it requires refreshing yourself on all things platform specific. In this project, that meant brushing up on iOS patterns and material design. As you can see below, differences like native
              screen resolution and design patterns must be considered to ensure the user has recognizable, intuitive patterns that they frequently use in other apps. For example, making use of the floating action button and the navigation drawer in
              the android app are gonna make users feel right at home. While, back buttons in the UI and access to your settings in the bottom tab bar is more the norm for iOS.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a time to break away from your native apps recommendations as well. For example, using elements from my style guide such as the font family for both platforms to give the visual brand a consistency on either platform that it
              wouldn't have otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              In product design, collaboration is key! I can't count the times a real break through was made thanks to another's perspective. If there was only one thing I could focus on to enhance my next product, it would be to collaborate with
              others as early and often as possible. Whether it's a design sprint with your product team or usability testing your low fidelity wireframes early in the discovery process, that's when the rubber hits the road!
