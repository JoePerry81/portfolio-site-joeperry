          Classifind is a classified app for posting, selling, purchasing and shipping goods from private parties. The focus from the start was on generating customizable user feeds based on user parameters.

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>Create a human-centered Classified app.</p>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>
              To provide relevant user feeds based on robust and flexible search parameters. As well as facilitate and simplify shipping services when required.

            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>
              There is more than one way to create wireframes and ponder user flows. Figma and Balsamiq are great tools when looking to explore and test such ideas. For me however, there is no replacement for pen and paper. It’s probably just my
              nostalgia talking; I mean, when else do you get to use these scribe relics anymore! To be fair, I still think it’s the fastest and flexible ways to get your ideas down, so you can start sharing your key features and user flows with your
              team.
            </p>
            <p>
              I find that starting on paper invariably speeds up my initial ideation process and without fail keeps me out of the business of making precise mid-fidelity wireframes that have major revisions I could have avoided all together.

            <h2>Layouts & Spacing</h2>
            <p>
              Pixel perfect design ideally begins early in the layout process. Once I know what platforms and resolutions I’m designing for I like to start exploring different grid options after taking things like the apps responsiveness into
              consideration. Starting early in the wireframe process with grids and vertical baselines in place will lend your product consistency as it invariably gets more complex in the iteration process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Native apps have guidelines that maintain things like minimum button sizes and spacing as well, and getting a grid in place early ensures your product is adhering to those guidelines.

            </picture>
            <h2>Style Guide</h2>
            <p>
              Speaking of guidelines, I like to keep a living style guide in my products while they are built out. A style guide, I would argue is the single most powerful tool a designer possesses for maintaining the brand of the product.
            </p>
            <p>
              The example below is a rudimentary example of a living style guide that I maintained while working on this project. When a project reaches the scope of having multiple contributors to the product; it’s best to expand on the style guide,
              so it turns into more of a story providing examples of best practices, and examples of dos and don’ts with important brand elements.

            <h2>Logo Iteration</h2>
            <p>
              The creative aspect of user interface design is what drew me to it. Logos marks, icons and style guides are often a user interface designer's time to let their creativity shine through. After a decade of experience in graphic design
              I've really come to relish this part of the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, if studying user experience philosophies has taught me one thing it's this: if the design enhances the experience, only then is it doing what it's intended. As a user interface designer I associate a lot of value to the design,
              it's my job. However, if the design is cluttering the user experience in any way, it will need to be adjusted accordingly. As a designer, I'll be the first to admit that you can grow attached to your designs. However, if the user is
              struggling to navigate your design, they'll close the app and not open it again and no one will see your "beautiful" design anyway. Take it from me, don't put the cart before the horse!

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Being the bargain bin hunter that I am, I’ve seen my fair share of classified apps. When tasked with overseeing the design and flow of one myself, I thought it would be easy to come up with a laundry list of features and patterns I had
              longed for when I was in the user’s shoes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I soon realized upon starting the discovery process with this project that finding fault and being critical of a product design is a heck of a lot easier than coming up with a better solution yourself. This realization has informed my
              process when it comes to competitive analysis. Now when I look at similar products to one that I’m working on, I pay close attention to what does work, not what doesn’t. That’s because the logical place to start is with a “minimum
              viable product”. If we, as an AGILE team, working on a product can focus on a core concept that offers a true value to our users, then you truly have something!
            </p>
            <p>
              Once that is established and the app has some traction with its users, then is the time to enrich the user experience with other features. In other words, keep it simple. This ensures your minimum viable product doesn’t get diluted by
              competing priorities and your minimum viable product remains the “mvp”. Once that is sorted out, you can revisit your” jobs to be done” list with all the knowledge of your users you’ve acquired and make an informed decision about what
              features will enrich the user experience.
